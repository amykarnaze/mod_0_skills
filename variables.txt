Assign a variable called food a string value of your choosing

var food = "pad thai, spring rolls, curry"

Assign a variable called is_delicious to a boolean value

var is_delicious = True


Re-assign your food variable to a new string

var food = "pizza, spinach, tomatoes"

Assign a variable called num2 to a numerical value

var num2 = 2

Assign a variable called num7 to a different numerical value

var num7 = 7

divide num7 by num2 and store the result in a variable called quotient

var quotient = num7 / num 2

Assign a variable called songs to an array of strings
var songs = ["you're not good enough", "it is what it is", "to build a home"]

You may use google for the following two:
Write a line of code that removes the first element from the songs array

songs.shift();

Write a line of code that asks how many characters there are in the food string
foods.length;
